## Breakdown
This repository is the public version of some of my smaller applications.

## Clone
Just to help speed up the process, go ahead and clone:
''' git clone https://github.com/terryyoung22/projects.git'''

## Features
Some of the big features I have to offer in this repository so far is:

* Github Actions pipeline - Working build of my nginx Container and soon to be Flask
* Python files - Something I focus on, since this is public I dont put the real head bangers in but still a good time!
* Web Framworks - Using Nginx and Flask!! again checkout that github actions part!
* Others lol - I also have some of my other language projects. Looking to build that out more when I get some free time.
